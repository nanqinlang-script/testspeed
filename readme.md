A convenient script to `test your server's speed which access to a node in China`

based on https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli

## main
no much things to explain

cuz it's a script using `Chinese language`

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanqinlang-script/testspeed/master/testspeed.sh
bash testspeed.sh
```

it's the best to say nothing !
